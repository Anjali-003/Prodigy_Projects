# Prodigy Internship Task 1

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. 

## Implementation
1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
2. Mount Google Drive: Mount Google Drive to access the dataset stored in a zip file.
3. Extract Dataset: Extract the dataset from the zip file into a specified directory.
4. Preprocess Images: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and expand dimensions to fit the model input.
5. Encode Labels: Encode categorical labels into numerical values and convert them to one-hot encoded vectors.
6. Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
7. Define CNN Model: Define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture for image classification.
8. Compile Model: Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
9. Train Model: Train the CNN model on the training data, with validation on the test data.
10. Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set and print accuracy and loss.
11. Visualize Training History: Plot the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
12. Make Predictions: Predict the labels for the test set and compare with true labels.
13. Visualize Predictions: Plot sample test images with their true and predicted labels to visually inspect model performance.
